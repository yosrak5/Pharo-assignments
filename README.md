# Pharo-Assignments 
## Overview
This repository contains two exercises, implemented in Pharo, as part of the task to experiment with the migration of Fortran code. The exercises cover:

Hollow Matrix Conversion: A program that converts a traditional matrix to a sparse matrix (hollow matrix) and vice versa.
Pharo Documentation Generator: A program that generates documentation for Pharo classes and packages, similar to JavaDoc.
Each exercise is accompanied by a test class that ensures the correctness of the implemented functionalities.
